            <p>You should agree that the average American house cat can be quite mysterious and often entertaining. Following are some interesting facts that you may or may not be aware of. Hopefully some of the information will enlighten you and solve some of those mysteries.</p>

            <h2>Do cats always land on their feet?</h2>
            <img src="lexi8.jpg" alt="Lexi up a tree" id="lexi">
            <p>No, they don't. Depending on the distance, they may or may not be able to. A short enough fall, less than two stories, a cat is more likely able to right themselves and land safely. Any height greater than that and their legs and paws may not be able to absorb the shock of the fall, causing injuries.</p>
            <p>The kitty pictured above was up a tree for the first time in her life. She was about 15 feet up and with no front claws, it was only a matter of time before she would test the theory about landing on her feet. After nearly an hour of teetering on thin branches, scared and exhausted, she slipped out of the tree and fell to the ground below. She did not land on all fours. Possibly branches along the way down prevented her front righting herself. Fortunately, she was uninjured.</p>

            <h2>Smelly cat??  Sweaty cat??</h2>
            <p>Even though cats do not have sweat glands like humans, they do cool off by sweating through their paws. In addition to cooling kitty, the sweat is also used to mark their territory. So they are actually marking their spot whenever they walk or scratch.</p>
            <h2>Mighty hunter??  Or threat??</h2>
            <p>As we all know, cats are naturally good hunters, even the average house cat. But I bet you didn't know that free-range, farrel cats and domesticated cats that spend a lot of time outdoors, are contributing to the extinction of 33 different species of mammals, birds and reptiles.</p>

            <h2>Confused kitty??</h2>
            <p>Like humans, senior cats may experience something like dementia or Alzheimers. If your senior cat wanders around the house constantly meowing, it may be because it is dazed or confused.</p>

            <h2>Do not trim the whiskers!</h2>
            <p>Cats rely on their whiskers to make sure their body will be able to fit through tight openings. The whiskers grow to be as long as the cat is wide. So if they bend going into an opening, they know it won't be able to fit.</p>
            <h2>On a more serious note...</h2>
            <h3>Household items that may be dangerous to your kitty.</h3>
